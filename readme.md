# Group D - MPP Course Repository

Welcome to the **Group D** repository for the **MPP Course**. This repository is used to upload and organize our work for each lab session.

## **Repository Structure**

- The repository is organized as follows:

  Lab1 <files related to Lab 1>

  Lab2 <files related to Lab 2>

  Lab3 <files related to Lab 3>

- Each lab directory contains all the files and materials for that specific lab.
- New directories will be created for subsequent labs as we progress through the course.

---

## **Usage Guidelines**

1. **Uploading Work**:

- Ensure that all files for a lab are placed in the appropriate directory (e.g., `/Lab1` for Lab 1).
- Use descriptive filenames to make it easy to identify the purpose of each file.

2. **Commit Messages**:

- Write clear and concise commit messages, specifying the lab and task (e.g., `Added UML diagram for Q3 in Lab 1`).

3. **Collaboration**:

- Review existing files in the repository before uploading to avoid conflicts.
- Coordinate with group members to ensure all work is accounted for.
