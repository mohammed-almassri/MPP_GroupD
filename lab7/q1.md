# Q1

### A

ArrayList implements the following interfaces:

- List
- RandomAccess
- Cloneable
- Serializable
- Iterable
- Collection

ArrayList extends the following class:

- AbstractList

### B

the problem is that `Employee` is incorrectly overriding the `equals` method which leads to the `contains` method on `List` to call the superclass `equals` method which compares the references of the objects instead of the content of the objects. To fix this, the `equals` method should be overridden to compare the content of the objects.
